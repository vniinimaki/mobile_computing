I used this guy's tutorials to implement the notifications and sensors' implementation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP623htmWcI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU-EAtITRRM 
Basically for the notifs you have to first check if you have an android version that requires creating a notification channel and then creating it if needed. Then I implemented a class that handles building and showing notifications.
I followed the tutorial where he implemented abstract classes to use with any kind of sensor. Then I created the sensor initialations and listeners in one of my views and added a immutable state that is updated when light sensor outputs less than 60 lux.
